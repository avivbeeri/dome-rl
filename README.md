# DOME-rl

An example framework for making a classic ASCII roguelike using [DOME](https://domeengine.com).

This provides a simple turn-based game loop inspired by [this article](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2014/07/15/a-turn-based-game-loop/) by Bob Nystrom, along with the framework for Actions and Actors (enemies, the Player, etc).

Everything else needs to be built yourself.

Great for the [7-Day Roguelike Challenge](https://itch.io/jam/7drl-challenge-2020)!
